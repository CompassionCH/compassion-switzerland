                    It is time to prepare the trip in terms of health. The stay that awaits you will be interesting. It can also be challenging: long international flights, jet lag, altitude changes, travel on rough roads, hiking on rough terrain and long days will be possible.

                    <br/>
                    Because we know that every individual is different, we collect health information from each registrant to be aware of their limitations and specific needs.

                    <br/>
                    <h3>2.1. Passport</h3>
                    Please check that your passport will be valid six months after the date of your planned return to Switzerland. If this is not the case, we ask you to renew your passport in order to guarantee you a worry-free trip.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h3>2.2. Insurance</h3>
                    Compassion does not have comprehensive insurance for participants on sponsor trips. We recommend that you check your health and accident insurance coverage. Trip cancellation insurance is strongly recommended. Indeed, once the flight ticket has been purchased and in the event of cancellation, you will be responsible for the costs. Do you have the <a href="https://www.tcs.ch/fr/produits/depannage-protection-voyage/assistance-voyage/livret-eti.php" style="color: skyblue; text-decoration: underline">ETI World TCS booklet (click here)</a>? This is a good insurance that covers international travel and cancellations.

                    <br/>
                    <h3>2.3. Visa</h3>
                    This trip will require a visa. To apply for a visa, go to the website of the "visa application" country or to https://www.dfae.admin.ch to find the necessary information. For ${event.country_id.name}, it is best to make the request [x time] before your departure.
