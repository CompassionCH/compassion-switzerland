                            TOGETHER is a community funding platform of Compassion, the child development NGO. Everyone can create their own fundraising campaign, alone or as part of a collective project, for development projects that are deployed in the countries of the South by Compassion.<br/><br/>
                            In just a few clicks, you can launch your own project. You set a goal and determine the end date. Then you invite your family and friends by e-mail, Facebook, Instagram, etc. to support your fundraising goal with a financial contribution.<br/><br/>
                            Donations can be made by credit card, Postcard or TWINT. Donations go directly to Compassion and will only be used for the selected projects. <b>All donations are tax-deductible, as Compassion is recognised as a non-profit organisation in all Swiss cantons.</b>
