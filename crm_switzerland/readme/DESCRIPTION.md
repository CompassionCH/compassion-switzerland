CRM Switzerland builds over crossover mass_mailing_partner and CRM modules which
gives difficulty to Church Reps handling their opportunities and contacts.
This is because the email address of partners and opportunities are synchronized
by default but prevents working with opportunities emails when the partner is
registered to a mailing list.

This module will override the synchronization of the email address of partners
so that the email address of opportunities can be different from the email
of the partner.
