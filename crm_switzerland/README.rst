CRM Switzerland builds over crossover mass_mailing_partner and CRM
modules which gives difficulty to Church Reps handling their
opportunities and contacts. This is because the email address of
partners and opportunities are synchronized by default but prevents
working with opportunities emails when the partner is registered to a
mailing list.

This module will override the synchronization of the email address of
partners so that the email address of opportunities can be different
from the email of the partner.
