============

1. The PostgreSQL extension pg_trgm should be available. In debian based distribution you have to install the postgresql-contrib module.

Add the following parameters to your Odoo configuration file:

* ``smb_user`` : user for connecting on the NAS of Compassion with Samba
* ``smb_pwd`` : password for Samba
