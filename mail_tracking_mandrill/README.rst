Mandrill Mail Tracking
======================

This module integrates
`Mandrill <https://mailchimp.com/features/transactional-email/>`_ (now known as Transactional-Email) with Odoo.
E-mails sent through Mandrill will be tracked using Mandrill Webhook Events.

Installation
============
In its current version the module does not support multi-database installation.

The module only dependency is `mail_tracking`.

No external python library are required.

Configuration
=============

Your Mandrill account must be configured in order to receive mail events via webhooks.

1. Launch Odoo with the newly installed module
2. Open the Mandrill web interface and select `new webhook` under the `setting` tab
3. Select the list of events you want to be notified about and set the url as follows

.. code:: html

    https://<your_domain>/mail/tracking/mandrill/<your_database>

If Mandrill displays an error it might be because it wasn't able to reach your url. Make sure
that your server is running and that the path to your route has been setup correctly.

Once the webhook has been successfully created on the Mandrill interface it will receive a `webhook key`.
This key is used to validate Mandrill request to your server and avoid undesired request from third party.
More info on `Mandrill's documentation <https://mailchimp.com/developer/transactional/guides/track-respond-activity-webhooks/#authenticating-webhook-requests>`_.

To enable the validation process copy the key you've found on Mandrill's interface
in your Odoo configuration file with the name `mandrill_webhook_key`.

.. code:: bash

    mandrill_webhook_key = <YOUR KEY>

If you choose **not** to specify the webhook key in your configuration file the route will
still be accessible by Mandrill. **But use caution as anyone with your url could trigger your route.**

Usage
=====

Once configured changes are invisible for the backend user. No views have been added or modified.
This module relies only on already existing ( trough `mail_tracking`) model `mail_tracking_email`.
The appropriated process function will be triggered when an event from Mandrill is received.
