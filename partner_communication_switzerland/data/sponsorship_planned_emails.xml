                    It may occur that children leave Compassion's sponsorship program. There are several reasons for this: war, famine, but also new job opportunities, better income of the family or simply the free choice of the child to work rather than to continue to go to the school program. We will inform you as soon as possible if this happens, and will suggest a new sponsorship to you. There are still a lot of children in need!
